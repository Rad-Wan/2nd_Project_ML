# Tanzania Tourism Prediction Project - README

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict tourist expenditure in Tanzania based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The goal is to understand factors influencing tourist spending and create an accurate predictive model to estimate how much tourists will spend when visiting Tanzania.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the processed dataset files
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Python code for the entire project
- `reports/`: Contains documentation, visualizations, and analysis results
  - `documentation/`: Technical report and presentation slides
  - `figures/`: Visualizations and charts

## Key Files
- `notebooks/tanzania_tourism_prediction.py`: Main Python script with all code
- `reports/documentation/technical_report.md`: Comprehensive technical documentation
- `reports/documentation/presentation_slides.md`: Presentation for non-technical stakeholders
- `models/gradient_boosting_tuned.pkl`: Best performing model (Gradient Boosting)
- `reports/model_evaluation.txt`: Detailed model performance metrics
- `reports/figures/`: Visualizations of model performance and feature importance

## Project Highlights
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting (RMSE: 1.1077, RÂ²: 0.5486)
- **Key Features**: Package tours (41%), leisure travel purpose (15%), length of stay (14%)
- **Recommendations**: Develop package tours, target leisure travelers, encourage longer stays

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure Python 3.x and required libraries are installed
2. Run the main script: `python notebooks/tanzania_tourism_prediction.py`
3. The script will load data, preprocess it, train models, and generate visualizations

## Project Completion
This project was completed as part of a Data Science boot camp Machine Learning assignment. All requirements have been met, including:
- Comprehensive data preprocessing
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Detailed documentation and visualizations
